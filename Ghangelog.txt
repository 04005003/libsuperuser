+++sorting out other versions later on after all ideas are done++++++++++++++

future updates
A lock screen so its harder to get into the app (working on it)

add dark or light theme (done)
add color change (done couple maybe add custom color) for this added color preference by Daniel Nilsson into the app project (done)
add custom actionbar for drawer that im making 
sort out all code to fit for all os as just wana release more stuff
instead of button gona add checkbox as its not worth having buttons if you dont know if it is already disabled/ enabled.
then add greyscale image so it looks like its disabled

considering removing fb as i havent implanted updates to it but add it back once finished 
added checkbox to all layouts in res for enable and disable
added save and loadPreference for checkbox
removed buttons for enabling/disalbling es filemanager

changed image of icon from wrap_content to 50dp just incase app icon that we will use later on shows bigger 

1.1.8
removed icon for material design like with color picker so it looks more like material for android lollipop
